# Meetings

This page covers basic expectations for meetings in the lab:

* Lab meetings for everyone (weekly)
* Subgroup meetings (fortnightly, new for 2021)
* 1-1 meetings (fortnightly)
* Socials (whenever we feel like it)

Meetings will be listed on the lab (google) calendar. Meetings won't take place over holidays or when they clash with other events, like conferences that multiple people in the lab are involved in.

For now, these meetings usually happen over zoom. 
When it's safe, we hope to move back to in-person meetings.


# Lab meetings for everyone (weekly)

Lab meetings are the regular opportunity for the whole group to come together to talk about science, and about important logistics.
Lab meetings are a mutually respectful and supportive environment.

Lab meetings can take various formats:

* Research update, led by a single lab member - this is most common
* One-slide meeting -  everyone presents one slide on their recent work.
* Journal club - one or more lab members present a relevant paper
* Guest presentation from someone outside the lab
* Other - for example, a "welcome back" meeting, a "write some of the lab manual" meeting, a "state of the lab" annual-ish meeting

Whatever the format, the goal of lab meeting is for everyone in the room, including the presenter, to learn things that are useful to their work.


## Timing - *updated January 2021*

Lab meetings are **15:30-17:00 Mondays** over zoom; see calendar invite for the zoom link.

We have historically tried to keep lab meetings to 1 hour, but they ended up closer to 1 and a half.
So our new approach is:

* 15:00 meeting opens, drift in with coffee/tea, chat and discuss lab business
* 15:30 prompt, presentation starts
* 16:45 latest, show the last slide
* 17:00 everyone should leave

We will discuss how well this is working after a few weeks.


## Giving a Research update lab meeting

The purpose of these lab meetings is to communicate and to exchange useful ideas, not to simply "update", nor to impress.
This will usually be a talk with slides, with sub-goals:

* Teach the group about your work.
* Articulate what you are thinking about your work's status and future.
* Solicit feedback and ideas from other lab members, to improve your project(s).
* Practice for talks outside the lab, in a friendly environment.

The key point is that the presentation must be accessible to everyone in the lab.
There is always a new student who hasn't heard about your project before.
There are also people who have heard you talk before, however, they are unlikely to remember those talks clearly, because they are human and also focused on their own project.
The presentation must be accessible to all of them, which requires thoughtful prioritisation of what you choose to present.

Research update presentations should usually:

* Give an introduction to your project, highlighting important ideas and objects (e.g. proteins/genes).
* Give each slide a helpful title, ideally a sentence that describes its content.
* Explain how to interpret each kind of data that you present, concisely and clearly. All data and axes need readable labels.
* Include a small number of crucial ideas/results from elsewhere, appropriately referenced.
* Make it clear when the talk shifts to your results; present selected primary data.
* Address problems, uncertainties, and obstacles.
* End with some kind of conclusion and plan for future work.

Lab members working on a new project will usually present a more in-depth introduction and  plans for future work, not any new data. 
Similarly, it can be important to present incomplete or inconclusive data in lab meetings; sometimes this leads to the most helpful discussions.
A well-thought-out lab meeting will strengthen your future work, by enabling a productive conversation with the group about your ideas and plans.

Aim for a 45-minute talk with at most one slide per minute, to allow time for discussion; a shorter talk is fine. It is a good idea to discuss your plan for lab meeting with the PI at least a week in advance.

Conversely, it is the responsibility of everyone else in the lab meeting to engage with the presenter and the presentation.
Everyone is welcome - indeed, encouraged - to ask questions.
We all bring value to lab meetings, and for each of us there are very many things we don't know; if one person has a question, it's likely other people have the same question.

# Subgroup meetings (fortnightly)

As of January 2021, we will try new "subgroup meetings" to help people working on related projects to talk regularly about them.

Here is a suggestion as to how we could run them:

* Everyone presents one slide on their recent work, taking no more than 5 minutes each (timed).
* Then we "journal club" a paper relevant to the subgroup, that everyone should already have read. Presentation of this can be shared around the group. We don't need perfect presentations, just enough for a good discussion.
* Everyone suggests papers for next subgroup meeting, and we decide on one of them. It is ok to suggest a paper that you have already read.
* PI aims to attend all subgroup meetings, however they should continue even if PI can't attend.
* Others in lab can attend subgroups as "guests" if they're interested in the paper.

Suggested subgroups (January 2021) are:

* Fungal pathogens - Laura, Liz, Rachael, also Thom.
* Ssd1 and so on - Rosey, Marah, Louis, also Paddy.
* 3'UTRs - Sam, Weronika, also Aphena.
* Ribosome profiling has a separate meeting, see [bbsrc-nsf repository](https://github.com/riboviz/bbsrc-nsf).

We will find times for these that work for all subgroup members, respecting lab shift patterns.


# 1-1 meetings (fortnightly)

Most lab members have 1-1 meetings with the PI, fortnightly, that last 55 minutes.
These guidelines are intended to be "as simple as possible" to make these meetings most pleasant and productive.

* The lab member takes notes and sends a summary to PI later on the day of the 1-1-meeting. Notes should begin "1-1 meeting notes [date]". (By email or slack? To discuss)
* Meeting starts by discussing progress on agreed priorities and action points from previous meeting.
* Meeting includes reviewing lab notebook, or other data/analysis/writing/slides, as appropriate.
* For wet lab workers, the lab notebook (RSpace) should be updated before the 1-1 meeting.
* Meeting ends by agreeing priorities for the lab member for their next fortnight, which go in the notes. Realistically, there will be between 1 and 3 priorities for the next two-week period, because larger numbers of things cannot all be prioritised.
* Notes should include action points for PI (with deadlines), and any questions arising from the meeting that we don't yet have answers to.
* Notes can be brief; whatever can be written up in 15 minutes is good enough.

Why bother with these guidelines and with writing notes?

* Guidelines are a [checklist](http://atulgawande.com/book/the-checklist-manifesto/) to make sure we cover the important points.
* Notes act as a "diary" of what we did, which makes it easier.
* It's pretty easy to misunderstand each other, especially on zoom. Written notes help to clear up those misunderstandings, and especially to clarify what is and is not a priority.

Project students should find these guidelines useful to make the most of their meetings with the PI and any co-supervisors, although the meetings may have a different frequency or format.


# Lab socials (whenever we feel like it)

Guidelines:

* Organize a lab social when you feel like it. 
* Be inclusive. 

We also have a regular lab coffee 10:30am Fridays.
Zoom link is on the lab calendar.
